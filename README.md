# timeboxed-frontend
Front end for Timeboxed

## Getting Started

In order to run locally, create a ```.env``` file that will be gitignored. This file will need to look like the following:

```
API_URL=http://localhost:3000
NODE_ENV=development
```

To start, enter the following command in your terminal: ```npm run watch```, and the application should open on http://localhost:8080.

You will also need to start the backend server and database for full functionality. See instructions here: https://github.com/TimeBoxed/timeboxed-backend
